1. Update Kali Linux:
  First update your Kali Linux system.
> sudo apt update
 sudo apt upgrade -y
2.Install Suricata
> sudo apt install suricata -y
3.Verify Installation
  By checking versipn of suricata 
> suricata --version
4.Configure Suricata
  Edit Suricata Configuration:Suricata’s configuration file is located at following location. Open it for editing
> sudo nano /etc/suricata/suricata.yaml
5. Set the correct interface by modifying the interface field under the af-packet section, Replace eth0 with the name of your network interface.
> af-packet:
  - interface: eth0
6. Set the HOME_NET Variable:
   The HOME_NET variable defines the range of IP addresses that Suricata is monitoring. Set HOME_NET to your local network or IP address (e.g., 192.168.0.0/24):
> home-net:
  - 192.168.1.32/24
7. Enable EVE JSON Output:
   Suricata can output event logs in JSON format. To enable JSON output, find the eve.json section in the suricata. yaml file and make sure it’s uncommented and configured:
> outputs:
  - eve-log:
      enabled: yes
      filetype: regular
      filename: /var/log/suricata/eve.json
  This will log alerts and network events in JSON format to above file path.
8. Set Up Suricata Rules
   Suricata comes with default rule sets, but you may want to update them to get the latest detection rules: 
> sudo suricata-update
9.  Create Custom Rules:
    Now you can add your custom detection rules. Suricata rules are stored in /etc/suricata/rules/. Create a custom rules file (local.rules). I put that file blank :
> sudo nano /etc/suricata/rules/local.rules
10. Update Suricata Configuration to Include Local Rules:
    Check that your custom rules are loaded by adding the following line to the suricata.yaml file in the default-rule-path section:
> rule-files:
  - /etc/suricata/rules/local.rules
11. Start Suricata to Monitor Traffic in IDS Mode:
    After configuring Suricata, you can start it in IDS mode (monitoring the traffic without dropping any packets):
> sudo suricata -c /etc/suricata/suricata.yaml -i eth0
12. Open New Terminal to Check the Suricata Logs:
    Suricata will log alerts to /var/log/suricata/eve.json. You can view these logs using following command:
> cat /var/log/suricata/eve.json
Now you are able to see logs in this file.
